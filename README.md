# SnakeGame
A simple snake game made in processing for a school assignment.</br>
The main feature of the game will be that the difficulty changes depending on the performance of the player.</br>

# Current tasks?
  -distance function for risk measurement (risk score increase while player close to ai) 
  -implement lives structure for player, so that instead of immediately dying, player loses length and lives</br>
  -implement lives structure for enemy</br>
  -Inter-snake death!</br>
  -(implement risky movements)</br>

# Features
Some ways we will implement this:</br>
1. Enemy changes (faster, bigger, more snakes, etc)
2. Enemy gets more or less aggressive (cuts you off or takes risks)
3. Power ups (chance of good power up changes)

# What do we need to do?
1. Measure risk (how much risk does the player take?)
2. Measure performance (how fast does the player get the food? how often does he fail? etc..)

# When do we need to do it?
-15th of May -> working prototype</br>
-30th of May -> adaptive prototype</br>
(1 week buffer to revise)</br>
